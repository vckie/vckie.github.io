One fine day I was Scrolling through tweets and my eyes got a tweet that [Dan Conn](https://medium.com/u/ebf8621987ec?source=post_page-----b82fbb561748--------------------------------) tweeted a osint challenge on Oct 5, 2021 mentioning his threads of #infostep2021.

When seeing this i got eager, and gave it a try. By going through his tweet threads the challenge was to find the building where he took this nice selfie.

Quite interesting right! So I went through his threads I got to know he started his ran here

So the fun starts here, I found in his profile that he is from Brighton, England. Also I saved this image and started searching images similar to this.

I noted that there are three benches, tennis court(you can zoom to find tennis court far away), and in front of that court there is a rows of small trees, and its kind of park, has left turn from where he took photo, and on right there is a road with vehicles.

Then I searched this image in google but its a broad approach and got many similar park images in various places around the world and in some interval I narrowed my search. I started searching for park bench stock photos in Brighton.

![Google Search](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*zsbJ_HtPtOUxTBICY3Ae7g.png)

In this search result alamy.com contains several stock phots of park benches. but I am looking for the exact bench model in his tweet.

And after scrolling I got the exact model of the bench same as in his post. It was [St Ann’s Well Gardens](https://goo.gl/maps/xi3oL8PZDMVSWj7b7)

Here you can find tennis court on top corner, i kept that as reference and comparing to his image, we can mark the exact location where he took that image while his ran starts. In below image I marked where he exactly stood and took that photo.

To confirm that, I went through street view in google map. and confirmed trees in front of Tennis court.

Ok for now, what to do with this location? literally I tried every street views of google map to find that colorful building and got struck here.

I tried for 2 to 3 days and left this challenge as it is. After 3 months I took it again and tried for a day and again struck. After a while I started searching for colorful buildings in his location (Brighton). But its a broad term to go through every images. I narrowed my search as “lgbtq building in Brighton”.

Scrolling every images in the result and got a building that exactly similar to his post and confirmed

And yes we got that building. Its [Club Revenge](https://g.page/ClubRevenge?share=) where he took selfie.

Here I conclude that by saying

1.  if you struck somewhere, jus leave it as it is. Try after relaxing your mind.
2.  Narrow down your thoughts or guesses, while doing OSINT challenges.
3.  Have to think out of the box to solve any problems.
4.  Always Read the scope, stick with it and try solving, because here I tried to find his location from where he was starting his run, but the scope was to find the building he took selfie.

Thanks for reading this. This was my first blog. If any mistakes or any suggestions please let me know. I’ll fix in next blog. Thanks to [Dan Conn](https://medium.com/u/ebf8621987ec?source=post_page-----b82fbb561748--------------------------------) for this awesome challenge.

Thanks for the time, Stay safe Stay healthy.
