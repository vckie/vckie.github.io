This is an example story to demonstrate how the Jekyll story collection system works.

To add your own story:
1. Add your PDF to `assets/pdfs/your-story.pdf`
2. Create a markdown file in `_stories/your-story.md` with frontmatter like this file
3. Jekyll will automatically generate the story listing and page!
